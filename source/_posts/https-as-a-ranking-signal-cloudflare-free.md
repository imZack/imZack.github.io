前幾天看到 Google 在 Webmaster Central Blog 發布 [HTTPS as a ranking signal](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.tw/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html)，主要是說...

>We've seen positive results, so we're starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it's only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.

隨後，知名 CDN 廠商 [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)，也發布了一則消息...[Google now factoring HTTPS support into search ranking]()

>In the meantime, if you want a quick way to boost your Google ranking, upgrading to any paid CloudFlare account will enable HTTPS by default. Even before we make it free, it's already the fastest, easiest way to get HTTPS support on any site.

只要升級任一方案，就有 SSL 可以用囉！有點心動...有人有使用心得嗎？
